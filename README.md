# SNPop
An application package for the collection, visualization and small scale analysis of catalogued data regarding single nucleotide polymorphismsacross populations.

Important: SNPanalysis utilizies the LDlinkR package, hence it requires a private user token to function. IF you wish to use SNPanalysis replace the string: 'user_token' in the code, with a token retrieved from: https://ldlink.nci.nih.gov/?tab=apiaccess.

The data flow/logic of SNPop's algorith is showcased in the figure below:
